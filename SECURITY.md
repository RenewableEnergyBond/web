### üîê Application Security

#### Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS and code injection
- **Input Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security audits of npm packages
- **TypeScript**: Static typing reduces runtime errors and vulnerabilities

#### API Security
- **Turnstile Protection**: CAPTCHA verification for all form submissions
- **Rate Limiting**: Cloudflare-level protection against abuse
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **CORS Configuration**: Strict cross-origin resource sharing policies

### üîç Monitoring & Detection

- **Real-time Logs**: Cloudflare Workers provide detailed request logging
- **Analytics**: Traffic monitoring for anomaly detection
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability checks in CI/CD
- **Build Security**: Secure build pipeline with verified dependencies

### üìö Security Best Practices

#### Development
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed before merging
- **Static Analysis**: TypeScript and ESLint catch potential issues
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular updates with security patches
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first configuration approach

#### Deployment
- **Immutable Deployments**: Static site generation with versioned assets
- **Environment Separation**: Clear separation between dev/staging/prod
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback for security incidents
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Gradual rollout minimizes exposure window

## Compliance & Standards

### Data Protection
- **GDPR Compliance**: Privacy-focused design for EU users
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect necessary user information
- **Cookie Policy**: Transparent cookie usage and user consent
- **Third-party Data**: Secure handling of external service integrations
